## Sets

Problems that are based on set data, which implies that the items have
no relations to one another and their ordering does not matter
(just a collection of values with no relationships).

Properties:
- Ordering does not matter, which enables sorting of the elements
- Items do NOT have the next / previous relationships, so indices and
  positions do not matter
- Only the presence and frequency of items matters, which is why
  counting is so popular.

Methods:
1. Counting - Recording frequencies / sums / pairs about the items
   in order to use it for producing a solution, either as pre-built
   information or as the running state.
2. Sorting - Ordering the items of the incoming set for scanning /
   searching for retrieving the results.
