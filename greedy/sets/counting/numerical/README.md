## Numerical Sets


Working with sets of numerical values that have a specific **bounded**
range that can be stored in a bounded-size numerical array.

Data-Structure: Number-Indexed Array, which stores the Counters / Records
corresponding to each numerical value.

Counting: Simply accessing the values at the correct indices.

Sorting: Using Counting-Sort as a subroutine / algorithm for ordering
all the numerical values using their frequencies.
