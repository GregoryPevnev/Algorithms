## Sorting using Two-Pointers

An unordered array can be sorted using custom logic
by keeping two pointers and swapping their numbers for ordering them
in a specific relative order (NOT completely / )

Pointers move until they cross or point to the same element, where
the end of the swapping is reached.

Pointers:
1. Start-Pointer - Moving forwards to the back from the front.
2. End-Pointer - Moving backwards to the front from the back.

Skipping: Moving the pointers when the value of interest is not
found on the either side of the pointer

**Important**: This idea is very similar to the Quick-Sort partitioning
logic / behavior.
